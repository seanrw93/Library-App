# Library App
* A web libray where you can add books(title, author, pages, read or unread) to the form and it will display it as tiles.
* Built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* Check out the live version [here]()

## Features:
* Pop up form that allows you to input information
* Books displayed as tiles on the screen
* Books stored in localStorage for future reference
* Delete and clear buttons
* CSS animations for improved UX

## Issues to return to:
* Firefox version does not display the div.empty-library, so the screen is just empty when there are no books stored in the library
* Firefox version has positioning issues with the the text content of button#addBook
