# Library App
* A web library where you can add books information to the form and it will display the result as tiles.
* Built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* Check out the live version [here](https://seanrw93.github.io/Library-App/)

## Features:
* Pop up form that allows you to input information
* Books displayed as tiles on the screen
* Books stored in localStorage for future reference
* Delete and clear buttons
* CSS animations for improved UX

## Issues to return to:
* Firefox version does not display the div.empty-library, so the screen is just empty when there are no books stored in the library
* Firefox version has positioning issues with the the text content of button#addBook
